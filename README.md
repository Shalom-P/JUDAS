# AI Assistant with Spotify Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered assistant that understands your music preferences and suggests songs based on your requests or conversation. It integrates with Spotify to seamlessly suggest and play tracks using natural language commands.

## Features

- **Intelligent Conversational Abilities**: The AI assistant will listen to what you have to say and when it feel's like responding it will, you can also have normal questions and interactions you would have with any other LLM.
- **Intelligent Song Suggestions**: The AI assistant uses advanced natural language understanding to suggest songs tailored to your mood, preferences, and commands, It can even consider the conversation you have had so far to suggest new songs.
- **Seamless Spotify Integration**: Leverages the Spotify API to play songs and have playback control without leaving your chat interface.
- **Text Commands**: Interact via text to get music recommendations in real-time.

## Installation

To run the SPOTIFY, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) with credentials (client ID, client secret, redirect URI)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shalom-P/JUDAS.git
   cd JUDAS
   virtualenv spotifyenv
   source spotifyenv/bin/activate
   pip3 install -r req.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   edit the `sample.env` file in the project root and add your Spotify API credentials:

   ```env
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:your-port
   HF_TOKEN=your-hugging-face-token-for-llama3.1
   ```

3. **Run Docker Compose**

   Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed, then run:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

4. **Access the Assistant**

   Once the Docker containers are running, you can interact with the AI music assistant through the interface provided.

## Usage

- Ask the assistant to **suggest songs based on mood**:
  
  ```
  "I'm feeling energetic, can you suggest something upbeat?"
  ```

- **Play specific songs** by name, artist, or genre:

  ```
  "Play some jazz music by Miles Davis."
  ```

- **Play songs based on the conversation so far**:
  ```
  "Suggest some songs that I may like based on the conversation so far."
  ```

## Spotify Authentication

The assistant uses Spotipy's `SpotifyOAuth` for authentication. The OAuth process is handled automatically without the need for manual token entry. Refer to the `.env` setup for supplying necessary credentials.

## Future Enhancements

- **Deeper Recommendation System**: Use collaborative filtering or user interaction history to provide more personalized song suggestions.
- **Multiple Music Services**: Expand the assistant to work with other music streaming platforms such as Apple Music or YouTube Music.
- **Customizable Playlists**: Build playlists on the fly based on themes, artists, or genres mentioned during the conversation.
- **Provide the rest of the api functionalities using RAG**: Will be able to also use your listening history and make full use of spotify's api's.
